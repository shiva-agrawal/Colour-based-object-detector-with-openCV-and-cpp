# Colour based object detector with C++ and openCV (Ubuntu 16.04)

One of the applications of the computer vision is to distinguish the objects based on their colors. This project is developed to fulfill this requirement. The application developed in this project takes an RGB image as input, and then it shows the sliders for the user to set the low and high threshold values for each RGB colors. Depending on the set values, correspoding color object is highlighted as white and rest of the image as black. This is demonstration of color based object detection. 

Project is developed using Eclipse CDT as IDE, OpenCV 3, C++ and Ubuntu 16.04 (Linux OS).
